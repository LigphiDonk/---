# Cosine Similarity Defense Verification Report

## Summary

The cosine similarity defense mechanism has been successfully verified in the PBFT-PVSS masked federated learning system. This defense mechanism helps identify and reject malicious model updates by measuring the cosine similarity between local model updates and the previous global model.

## Implementation Verification

We verified that:

1. The cosine similarity defense mechanism is implemented in the `pbft_client.py` file, with the following key functions:
   - `set_cosine_defense()`: Configure the defense mechanism
   - `calculate_update_similarity()`: Calculate the cosine similarity between updates

2. The defense can be enabled via command-line parameters:
   - `--use_cosine_defense`: Enable cosine similarity defense
   - `--cosine_threshold`: Set the threshold value (default: -0.1)

3. The bootstrap node successfully passes these parameters to client nodes.

## Functionality Testing

We conducted the following tests:

1. **Basic verification test**: 
   - `python verify_cosine_defense.py`
   - Results: Normal updates (similarity ~0.02) pass the threshold check (-0.1)
   - Malicious updates (similarity ~-0.75) fail the threshold check

2. **End-to-end simulation**:
   - `python test_cosine_defense_e2e.py --malicious 2 --use_defense --threshold -0.1`
   - Results: The malicious node (ID: 2) was successfully identified and its updates were rejected in rounds 2-5
   - Without defense, all updates including malicious ones were accepted

3. **Actual system test**:
   - Started the PBFT system with cosine defense enabled
   - Confirmed defense parameters were properly propagated to all nodes
   - Log files show successful setup of cosine similarity defense with threshold -0.1

## Evidence of Implementation

From the logs, we can see:
```
INFO:PBFTClient:节点 0 设置余弦相似度防御: 启用=True, 阈值=-0.1
INFO:PBFTStarter:引导节点 0 启用余弦相似度防御，阈值: -0.1
```

```
INFO:PBFTClient:节点 1 设置余弦相似度防御: 启用=True, 阈值=-0.1
INFO:FedClient:客户端 1 启用余弦相似度防御，阈值: -0.1
```

## Visual Evidence

The system generated visualization of defense performance:
- `cosine_similarity_with_defense.png`: Shows malicious updates being rejected
- `cosine_similarity_no_defense.png`: Shows malicious updates being accepted

## Conclusion

The cosine similarity defense mechanism has been successfully implemented and is working as expected. The system can detect and reject model updates that are significantly different from the current consensus, potentially preventing poisoning attacks.

### Recommended Configuration

Based on our tests, we recommend setting the cosine similarity threshold to `-0.3639`, as this provides good separation between normal and malicious updates while maintaining flexibility.

To use this defense mechanism, start the system with:
```bash
python pbft_startup.py --use_cosine_defense --cosine_threshold=-0.3639
```

And for clients:
```bash
python experiments_client.py --use_pbft --bootstrap=0,127.0.0.1,12000 --use_cosine_defense --cosine_threshold=-0.3639
```
